# BezierCurveCubic

This Bézier Curve model creates a cubic curve with four control points: P0, P1, P2, and P3 respectively. The points may be translated across the screen and the curve will be manipulated accordingly.

The curve begins at point P0 and ends at point P3. This is specific to a Bézier Curve of third order (n = 3). In general, the curve always begins at P0 and ends at Pn. The remaining points in between behave as 'magnets', pulling the curve towards them.
